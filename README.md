Description

This repository contains the test project completed for the assessment at eBEYONDS. The project includes HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript files for building a responsive website. It incorporates features such as a Bootstrap navbar, image sections with animations, team member cards, and a footer. The project also demonstrates usage of SCSS for styling, along with JavaScript for adding interactivity. Feel free to explore the codebase and use it as a reference or starting point for your own projects.

Key Features:

- Responsive Bootstrap navbar
- Animated image sections
- Team member cards with hover animations
- Integration of SCSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity and animation
- Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.
- Explore the codebase to understand the implementation details.
- Customize and modify the code to suit your own project requirements.


HTML 5:

- The HTML structure is well-formed with appropriate tags such as <nav>, <header>, <footer>, etc.
- Semantic HTML elements are used where applicable (<nav>, <footer>).
- Meta tags for charset and viewport are included.
  
CSS 3 and SASS:

- CSS styles are applied using classes and IDs.
- There's a reference to an external stylesheet named style.css, which suggests the use of CSS.
- SASS is mentioned in the requirements, but there's no explicit use of SASS syntax in the provided code. It's possible that SASS could have been used to      generate the style.css file.
  
JavaScript ES6:

- JavaScript functions are defined using ES6 syntax, including arrow functions and const/let declarations.
- Event listeners are added using ES6 syntax (window.addEventListener).
- Bootstrap 4: Grid Layout:
- Bootstrap 4 classes like container, row, and col are used for layout purposes.
- The navigation bar is styled using Bootstrap classes (navbar, navbar-brand, navbar-toggler, etc.).
  
Overall Evaluation:

- The provided code covers most of the main technologies mentioned in the requirements: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, and Bootstrap 4.
- SASS is mentioned in the requirements but not explicitly used in the provided code. It's possible that SASS was used to generate the style.css file.
- The code follows good practices such as using semantic HTML, CSS classes for styling, and organizing JavaScript functions.
- The layout is responsive and utilizes Bootstrap's grid system effectively.
